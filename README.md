# TripGenerator
A very simple and somewhat randomized Python animation.

Heavily inspired by the animation program found in Chapter 18 of _Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python (4th Edition)_ by Al Sweigart.

A 500x500 window is created, as well as two 3x3 Rect objects ("dots) that are organized into dictionaries. A while loop continuously draws these dots while they move and bounce around the edges of the screen. This creates a simplistic "psychedelic" effect that is a bit of an eye strain but also kind of cool to watch. A timer changes the color of the dots every 2 seconds, randomly choosing between red, green, blue, purple, white, and black.
