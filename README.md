# TripGenerator
A very simple and somewhat randomized Python animation.
Heavily inspired by the animation program found in Chapter 18 of __Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python (4th Edition)__ by Al Sweigart.

A 500x500 window is created, as well as two 3x3 pixel dots that are represented by dictionary data structures. A while loop continuously draws these dots while they move and bounce around the edge of the screen. This creates a simplistic "psychedelic" effect that is a bit of an eye strain but also kind of cool to watch. A timer is used to randomly change the color of the dots between red, green, blue, purple, white, and black.
